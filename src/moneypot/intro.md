MoneyPot is a practitioner-led grantmaking fund for the arts and culture individuals and groups who are breathing life into the Solidarity Economy. We resource artists who make systems change irresistible. Since launching our report in 2021, Art.coop’s small team has developed 7 week learning sessions, four self-paced courses and a seven-episode podcast. Learn more about the team and community at Art.coop.

#### HOW IT WORKS

**We are prototyping a practitioner-led model of wealth redistribution**

- **Cultivation**: Art.coop staff invite MoneyPot gifts
- **Allocation**: MoneyPot allocation is practitioner-led; decisions are made by both Art.coop members and staff.
- **Distribution**: Fund withdrawal is self-determined by the recipient through Open Collective’s open-source platform, and funds are utilized by recipients in any way that supports them.
- **Observation**: All MoneyPot participants observe the impact of the flow of money in and through the Art.coop ecosystem.

#### HOW IS THE MONEYPOT ALLOCATED?

**Criteria**

**We redistribute money to the artists and culture-bearers who are building movements for community control.**

- U.S. based poor and working-class, queer, disabled, trans and BIPOC artists.
- Actively and regularly participating in Art.coop Solidarity Economy programming and other skill sharing.

#### MoneyPot Backstory

In 2023, Art.coop sent out a survey to the 2000+ people in our network to ask them what they would want to see us do to expand the work of the Solidarity Economy (SE) into more explicitly supporting arts and culture bearers across the world. The answers we received overwhelmingly called for a membership model that Art.coop would use to transform funding and resourcing to meet the needs of the creatives sustaining SE work. We’ve since built this platform, which allows individuals with wealth to redistribute their resources — and therefore parts of their power — into the Solidarity Economy through a membership program.
