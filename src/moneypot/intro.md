#### HOW IT WORKS

**We are prototyping a practitioner-led model of wealth redistribution**\

- Cultivation: Art.coop staff invite in MoneyPot contributors (both active new members and non-voting contributors)\
- Allocation: MoneyPot allocation is determined both by Art.coop members and staff \
- Distribution: Fund withdrawal is initiated by the recipient through the Open Collective open-source platform, and funds are utilized by the recipient in any way that supports them\
- Observation: All MoneyPot stakeholders observe the impact of the flow of money in and through the Art.coop ecosystem{Link to download more about allocation logic and detail for those who are interested}\

#### HOW IS THE MONEYPOT ALLOCATED?

- We redistribute money to the artists and culture-bearers who are building movements for community control:
- U.S. based poor and working-class, queer, disabled, trans and BIPOC artists
  Actively and regularly participating in Art.coop Solidarity Economy programming and other skill sharing
- Imagining collective future as well as building the infrastructure to realize it
- Committing resources to the Art.coop community through annual membership dues
